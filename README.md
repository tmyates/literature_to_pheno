# literature_to_pheno

This repo can be used to extract Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from full text literature downloaded using Cadmus (https://zenodo.org/record/5618052#.YvZuGS8w2Am).

The hp.obo file needs to be downloaded from https://hpo.jax.org/app/. 

A UMLS licence is required to use MetaMap (https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/signup-login), and this needs to be installed locally. 

The ontobio package needs to be installed https://ontobio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#
